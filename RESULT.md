# Clustering via K-means algorithm

In this computer project, the goal is to design an RBF network with different numbers of centroids (e.g. 20, 4, and etc.) to solve a binary classification problem. I do not use any existing machine learning library, including libraries for the k-means algorithm, and I implemented the algorithm by my own. There are two classes of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_1={\{x_i : d_i = -1\}}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C_{-1}={\{x_i : d_i = -1\}}"> that we want to predict the correct labels of these classe's data-points.




The region where  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_i"> is 1 is the union of the region that remains below the mountains and the region that remains inside the sun in the figure below.
